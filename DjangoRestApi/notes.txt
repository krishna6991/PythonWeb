how to develop an api quickly using the Django rest framework and django.
we are using django 2.0
Test Driven development, before you can code the bussiness login of your api, you will need to write a test.

Serializer:
it allows complex data such as  querysets and model instances to be converted to native Python datatypes that can than be easily rendered into JSON, XML or other contents types.
-Serializers also provide deserialization, allowing parsed data to be converted back into complex types.
-It works so similar to Django's Form and Modelform classes.

API versioning:
an Api is contract between the backend and clients that consume it.
API versioning allows you to alter behaviour between different clients and "polietly" depracate old codes from old clients. 
-when api versioning is enabled, the request.version attribute will contain a string that corresponds to the version requested in the incoming client request.
